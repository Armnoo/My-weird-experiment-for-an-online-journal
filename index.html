how does this look like
<br> the color in the sky
<br>the wind in the air 
<br> knowing for the next moment end
<br> in just flash
<br> forget the simplicity 
<br> beauty
 <br>in such a small fashion of places 
<br>now we forget to pause
<br> ourselves thinking the next future of our lives 
<br>it could be simple as waking up or
<br> challenging as thinking for a career
<br> you might enjoy living life to the fullest is something 
<br>I'd believed know what treacherous  paths  
<br>  I come and cross  
<br>  in the likely hood I "failed" 
<br> is gonna come across are paths  
<br> eventually, if you learn your mistakes 
<br>  you adapt yourself from this commotion 
<br>  and this unforgettable barrier of  
<br> your fear vs your will
<br> it starts to question why do we have to lose  
<br> our dignity  
<br> our sanity our egos  
<br> our pride 
<br> from these seem able immovable events of mistakes
<br>  to turn to our mental torture of humiliation
<br> to admit ourselves to defeat </font></p>
